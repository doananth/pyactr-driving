# pyactr-driving
Spring 2020 Independent Study

This is an initial implementation of the Python code for ACT-R using the Java files "Model of Driving" from:
https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~salvucci/cog/act-r/projects.php

There is still work being developed in this as other files are needed for the simulation and to use certain functions that were provided.
